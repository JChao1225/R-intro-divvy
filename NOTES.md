# Instructor notes

## Post-workshop notes

+ It would be good to show another example of a "geom" other than
  `geom_point`. Maybe `geom_density` or `geom_text`?

## Instructor in-class setup

+ Arrange chairs and tables, if necessary.
+ Use Terminal (not iTerm).
+ Use "My Settings" Terminal theme (with Consolas font)
+ Simplify bash prompt.
+ Clean up Desktop and quit applications (particularly Slack).
+ Arrange PDF of slides and Terminal on screen.
+ Start up R with the wrong working directory.
+ Create handout.pdf and print it out.
