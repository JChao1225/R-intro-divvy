# Instructor notes

## Post-workshop notes

+ Add a "What's included" slide, as well as a "What's included"
  section to the README.

+ Some participants might not have enough memory to load all the
  data. If that is the case, they can just load some of the files.

+ When we revisit the trip data in "Create a map of the Divvy
  stations", remind participants that we only looked at a portion of
  the data.

+ Create a slide giving a summary of what function `read.divvy.data`
  does.

+ Change `na` argument in `read_csv` call to be less confusing, and
  explain that `read_csv` does many things automatically (e.g.,
  handling missing data)

+ When "reordering" the data frame rows, we might ask, what was the
  *original* ordering?

+ Add more text to "what is a factor"?

+ The slides "Convert station columns to factors" and "Summarizing
  trips by station" are probably too complicated for an introductory
  workshop.

+ Simplify the plot adjustments in order to simplify the code.

+ It would be good to show another example of a "geom" other than
  `geom_point`. Maybe `geom_density` or `geom_text`?

## Instructor in-class setup

+ Arrange chairs and tables, if necessary.
+ Use Terminal (not iTerm).
+ Use "My Settings" Terminal theme (with Consolas font)
+ Simplify bash prompt.
+ Clean up Desktop and quit applications (particularly Slack).
+ Arrange PDF of slides and Terminal on screen.
+ Start up R with the wrong working directory.
