Code implementing the data analyses should be stored here. This code
should be run from inside this directory; that is, the working
directory in your R environment should be set to the "analysis"
directory.

All data downloaded from the original sources ("raw data") should also
be stored here. Large data files should not be commited to the git
repository. If small data files are committed, make sure that data
usage conditions are being correctly followed (e.g., sometimes data
files cannot be made publicly available).

Also included in this directory is the R Markdown source used to
generate the slides.
