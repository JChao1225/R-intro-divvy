2. Aims of workshop
===================

1. Work through a basic data analysis in R.

2. Understand how to import data from a CSV file into an R data frame.

3. Use standard tools to summarize & manipulate data frames.

4. Learn how to install & use R packages.

5. Use ggplot2 to create plots from data frames.

6. Learn through "live coding"—this includes learning from our
   mistakes!

# 3. Our goal: Analyze Divvy data from 2016 & 2017

+ Investigate bike sharing trends in Chicago.

+ We will use data made available from Divvy:

    - www.divvybikes.com/system-data

+ Much of the effort will be spent importing the data, inspecting the
  data, and preparing the data for analysis.

+ Once we have carefully prepared the data, creating visualizations is
  (relatively) easy.

4. It's your choice
===================

Your may choose to...

+ Use R on your laptop.

+ Use RStudio on your laptop.

+ Use R or RStudio on the RCC cluster.

+ Pair up with your neighbour.

+ Follow what I do on the projector.

**Note:** If you use the RCC cluster I'm assuming you know how to set
up an interactive computing session with appropriate amount of compute
time and memory, load R or RStudio, and display graphics (e.g., using
ThinLinc).

Software we will use today
==========================

1. **R**

2. R packages **readr**, **ggplot2** & **cowplot**.

3. **RStudio** (optional).

**Note:** I'm assuming you have already installed R and/or RStudio on
your laptop, or you are using the RCC cluster.

Outline of workshop
===================

1. Initial setup.

2. Load & prepare the Divvy station data.

3. Load & prepare the Divvy trip data.

4. Create a map of the Divvy stations.

5. Create plots comparing bike sharing in 2016 & 2017.

Initial setup
=============

+ WiFi

+ Power outlets

+ Pace, questions (e.g., keyboard shortcuts).

+ Help.

Download or "clone" git repository
==================================

Download the workshop packet to your computer.

+ Go to: [**http://github.com/rcc-uchicago/R-intro-divvy**][github-repo]

+ To download, click the green **"Clone or download"** button.

Or, if you have **git**, run this command:

```{bash download-repo, eval=FALSE}
git clone https://github.com/rcc-uchicago/
  R-intro-divvy.git
```

(Note the URL in the git command should not contain any spaces.)

+ **Note:** If you are using the RCC cluster, also download workshop
  packet on the cluster.

What's included in the workshop packet
======================================

1. **analysis**: directory where the code and data for our analyses
   will be stored.

2. **slides.pdf**: the workshop slides.

    + This PDF is useful for copying & pasting code from the
      slides. (Although I have found that you should only copy one
      line at a time.)

    + The PDF is included in the workshop packet.

    + You can also view the PDF by clicking the "slides.pdf" item on
      the GitHub webpage.

Set up your R environment
=========================

+ Launch R or RStudio.

+ *We will run all the code from the **"analysis"** folder*.

+ To change your working directory:

    + In R, use `setwd()` function.

    + In RStudio, select **Session > Set Working Directory > Choose
      Directory...`**

Before continuing, check that you have the right working directory:

```{r check-wd}
getwd()  # Should end with "analysis".
```

Run `sessionInfo()`
===================

Check the version of R that you are using:

```{r check-version}
sessionInfo()
```

If you are using an older version of R (version 3.3 or less), I
strongly recommend upgrading to the latest version. *Some of the
examples may not work in older versions of R.*

Check your R environment
========================

The R environment is where all variables and functions are stored and
accessed. You should start with an empty environment:

```{r check-env}
ls()
```

If you see names of objects listed, it means your environment is
not empty, and you should restart R with a clean environment.

+ Do `rm(list = ls())`.

+ Or, in RStudio, go to **Session > Restart R**.

Creating a file to keep track of your analysis code
===================================================

+ In RStudio, select **File > R Script**.

+ Alternatively, use your favourite editor.

+ Add some comments to the title to remind yourself what this file is
  for, e.g.,

    ```
    # Some of the R code I wrote during the RCC
	# workshop on August 16, 2018.
    ```

+ Save the file in the [**"analysis"**](../analysis) folder.
  Name the file whatever you'd like (e.g., `divvyanalysis.R`).

The Console is the "brains" of RStudio
======================================

![](docs/images/rstudio.jpg)

Download the Divvy data
=======================

+ Disk space required: at least **2 GB**.

+ Download the 2016 & 2017 data files from here:

    + [**www.divvybikes.com/system-data**][divvy-data]

+ Download them to the [**"analysis"**](../analysis) folder.

+ You should have 4 ZIP files:

    ```
    Divvy_Trips_2016_Q1Q2.zip
    Divvy_Trips_2016_Q3Q4.zip
    Divvy_Trips_2017_Q1Q2.zip
    Divvy_Trips_2017_Q3Q4.zip
    ```

+ Decompress ("unzip") all of these files.

Check that you have all the files 
=================================

After unzipping, you should have **15** CSV files.

```{r list-files}
Sys.glob("*.csv")
```

*If you don't see all 15 CSV files, you have not successfully
downloaded and/or unzipped all the files in the "data" directory.*

Outline of workshop
===================

1. Initial setup.

2. **Load & prepare the Divvy station data.**

3. Load & prepare the Divvy trip data.

4. Create a map of the Divvy stations.

5. Create plots comparing bike sharing in 2016 & 2017.

Eyeball the station data in the CSV file
========================================

+ Open the CSV file **Divvy_Stations_2017_Q1Q2.csv** in RStudio, or in
  your favourite text editor (e.g., Notepad in Windows, TextEdit on
  Mac).

+ CSV is a simple and commonly used data format.

+ It is easily read into R, and read by humans.

+ Each line stores an item (station).

+ The first line is a special line called the "header".

+ Entries in each line (table row) are separated by commas.

Import the station data into R
==============================

Load the most up-to-date station data into an R "data frame":

```{r read-station-data}
stations<-read.csv("Divvy_Stations_2017_Q3Q4.csv",
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

This will define a new object, "stations", in your environment:

```{r inspect-station-data-1}
ls()
```

It is a "data frame" object:

```{r inspect-station-data-2}
class(stations)
```

*What does "read.csv" do, and what is a "data frame"?* R has detailed
documentation:

```{r help-readcsv-dataframe, eval=FALSE}
help(read.csv)
help(data.frame)
```

Inspect the station data
========================

Run these commands to start inspecting the station data:

```{r inspect-station-data-3}
nrow(stations)
ncol(stations)
head(stations)
tail(stations)
summary(stations)
```

Inspect the data in more detail:

```{r inspect-station-data-4}
sapply(stations,class)
object.size(stations)
print(object.size(stations),units = "Kb")
```

*What do we learn about the station data from running these
commands? Does this reveal any issues with the data?*

Take a closer look at the "dpcapacity" column
=============================================

Create a new object containing only the "dpcapacity" column:

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-1}
x <- stations$dpcapacity
```

Run these commands to take a closer look at the "dpcapacity" column:

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-2}
class(x)
length(x)
summary(x)
table(x)
```

*Did we gain any additional insight from running these commands?*


Selecting rows & columns
========================

Select first 4 rows of "name" column:

```{r select-rows}
stations$name[1:4]
stations[1:4,2]
stations[1:4,"name"]
```

Select first 4 rows and multiple columns:

```{r select-columns}
stations[1:4,c(2,3,6)]
stations[1:4,c("name","city","dpcapacity")]
```

Getting the row and column names:

```{r station-names}
colnames(stations)
rownames(stations)
```

Take an even closer look at "dpcapacity"
========================================

It is interesting that a few of the Divvy bike stations are much
larger than the others, whereas others have no docks. Where are these
stations?

```{r inspect-dpcapacity-data-3}
subset(stations,dpcapacity == 0)
subset(stations,dpcapacity >= 40)
```

Alternatively, we can sort the table rows, then inspect the top and
bottom rows:

```{r inspect-dpcapcity-data-4}
rows <- order(stations$dpcapacity,decreasing=TRUE)
stations2 <- stations[rows,]
head(stations2)
tail(stations2)
```

*How were the rows originally ordered in `stations`?*

Take a closer look at the "city" column
=======================================

Above we inspected *numeric* data. Next's, let's look at an example of
non-numeric data.

```{r inspect-city-data-1}
x <- stations$city
class(x)
summary(x)
```

The summary is not very useful here! The key is to convert to a
"factor" (categorical variable):

```{r inspect-city-data-2}
x <- factor(stations$city)
class(x)
summary(x)
```

*Did you discover an issue with the data from running these commands?*

Improving the "city" column
===========================

Let's fix the problem we found earlier. First, select the offending
rows of the table:

```{r revise-city-data-1}
rows <- which(stations$city == "Chicago ")
```

Fix the "city" column by overwriting the "city" entries in the
selected rows:

```{r revise-city-data-2}
stations[rows,"city"] <- "Chicago"
summary(stations$city)
```

The "city" column is more useful if it is a factor, so let's convert
the column directly inside the data frame:

```{r revise-city-data-3}
stations$city <- factor(stations$city)
summary(stations$city)
```

What is a "factor"?
===================

Factors are often very useful in data analyses. Let's take a deeper
look at what a factor *is*.

```{r inspect-factor}
x <- stations$city
attributes(x)
unclass(x)
```

From the `unclass(x)` call, we see that a factor is really just an
integer with values 1, 2, 3, *etc*., with which each integer value is
associated with a *label* (e.g., "Chicago", "Evanston").

Save your code & session state
==============================

It is important to periodically save:

1. your code,

2. the state of your R environment.

To save your environment, go to **Session > Save Workspace As...** in
RStudio, or run this code:

```{r save-session-1}
save.image("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

Later, to restore your environment in a new session, select **Session >
Load Workspace...** in RStudio, or run this code:

```{r load-session, eval=FALSE}
load("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

Outline of workshop
===================

1. Initial setup.

2. Load and prepare the Divvy station data.

3. **Load and prepare the Divvy trip data.**

4. Create a map of the Divvy stations.

5. Create a scatterplot comparing bike sharing activity in 2016
   and 2017.

Import the Divvy trip data into R
=================================

Previously, we used `read.csv` to import station data into R. Let's
now use `read.csv` to load the trip data from the 4th quarter of 2017:

```{r read-trip-data}
trips <-
  read.csv("Divvy_Trips_2017_Q4.csv",
           stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

You may find that this command look longer to run than
before. Consider that the trips data is much larger:

```{r trip-data-size}
nrow(trips)
ncol(trips)
print(object.size(trips),units = "Mb")
```

This gives an opportunity to demonstrate a faster method
implemented in a *package*.

Import Divvy trip data using `readr` (optional)
===============================================

Install the **readr** package from CRAN:

```{r install-readr, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("readr")
```

Load the functions from the package into your R environment:

```{r load-readr}
library(readr)
```

Let's use the `read_csv` function from this package:

```{r read-trip-data-readr}
trips <- read_csv("Divvy_Trips_2017_Q4.csv")
```

**Note:** `read_csv` is similar to `read.csv`, but not the same.

+ *How much faster is `read_csv`?*

Import Divvy trip data using `readr` (optional)
===============================================

The `read_csv` output is *not* a data frame—it is a "tibble".

```{r check-trip-data-class}
class(trips)
```

Typically, I convert it to a data frame:

```{r convert-trip-data}
class(trips) <- "data.frame"
```

+ For more on tibbles, see:

    - http://r4ds.had.co.nz

+ The **readr** package has many other features not covered here.

+ Another fast method is `fread` from the **data.table** package.

More on packages in R
=====================

"Vignettes" are a great way to learn about a package:

```{r readr-vignette, eval=FALSE}
vignette(package = "readr")
vignette("readr")
```

+ CRAN is the official package source:

    - https://cran.r-project.org.

+ Other good places to find packages:

    - Bioconductor
    - GitHub.

+ *What packages are already installed?*
  `rownames(installed.packages())`

+ *Where do the packages live?* `.libPaths()`

+ *How to learn more about a package?* `help(package=readr)`

A first glance at the trips data
================================

Let's use some of the same commands we used earlier to quickly get an
overview of the trip data:

```{r inspect-trip-data}
nrow(trips)
ncol(trips)
head(trips)
summary(trips)
```

Unfortunately, the summary command isn't particularly informative for
many of the columns.

+ *What columns should we convert to factors?*

Convert "gender" to a factor
============================

Let's start by converting the "gender" column to a factor:

```{r convert-trip-data-1}
trips$gender <- factor(trips$gender)
summary(trips$gender)
levels(trips$gender)
```

We observe that many gender entries are missing.

"Missing" data
==============

+ In R, "missing data" should always be assigned the special value `NA`
  ("not available" or "not assigned").

+ Many functions in R will correctly handle missing data as long as
  they are encoded as `NA`.

+ The `read_csv` function from the `readr` package is "smart" enough
  to figure out that blank entries in the CSV file should be converted
  to `NA`.

Convert "station" columns to factors
====================================

It is also useful to convert the "from station" column to a factor:

```{r summarize-from-station-data}
summary(trips$from_station_name)
trips$from_station_name <-
  factor(trips$from_station_name)
summary(trips)
```

The summary is now more informative.

A note about dates & times
==========================

+ `summary(trips)` is also not useful for the
dates & times.

+ Processing dates & times is more complicated.

+ See `help(strptime)` and the **lubridate** package.

Preparing data is tedious
=========================

Data preparation is sometimes >90% of the effort!

+ *Many analysis mistakes are due to poor data preparation.*

Common issues include:

+ Formatting mistakes in CSV file.

+ Converting table columns to the appropriate data type.

+ Entry inconsistencies (e.g., additional spaces).

+ Missing data.

+ Many other examples of Poor Practices in recording data.

(And we haven't yet dealt with merging data from multiple files—this
usually creates more headaches!)

Moving beyond data preparation
==============================

+ So far, we have illustrated a few of the challenges of working with
  large tabular data sets ("data frames").

+ In order to proceed to fun stuff, I've automated the data
  preparation steps by writing a *function* in R to import and merge
  all the Divvy data into a single data frame.

Outline of workshop
===================

1. Initial setup.

2. Load & prepare the Divvy station data.

3. Load & prepare the Divvy trip data.

4. **Create a map of the Divvy stations.**

5. Create plots comparing bike sharing in 2016 & 2017.

Clean up your environment
=========================

Here, we will begin a new analysis, so let's refresh our environment:

```{r clean-up-environment}
rm(list = ls())
```

Or, in RStudio, go to **Session > Restart R**.

Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=================================

So far, we have only analyzed the trip data from the 4th quarter
of 2017.

```{r load-functions}
source("functions.R")
```

I wrote a function `read.divvy.data` to automate the reading and
processing of all the downloaded Divvy data. It reads all the CSV
files, then merges them into two data frames: one for the stations, and
one for the trips.

Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=================================

Choose which station and trip files to import:

```{r import-divvy-data-1}
stnfile   <- "Divvy_Stations_2017_Q3Q4.csv"
tripfiles <- Sys.glob("Divvy_Trips*.csv") 
```

Variables `stnfile` and `tripfiles` contains the names of the files to
be importedl they do not actually contain any data.

Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=================================

This may take a minute to run, or longer if you have not installed the
readr package.

```{r import-divvy-data-2}
divvy <- read.divvy.data(stnfile,tripfiles)
```

**Note:** If your computer does not have enough memory to load all the
trip data, use only the Q1 trip files instead:

```{r import-divvy-data-1a, eval=FALSE}
tripfiles <- Sys.glob("Divvy_Trips*Q1.csv")
```

What `read.divvy.data` does:

+ Reads the Divvy station data from the CSV file.

+ Reads the Divvy trip data from the CSV files.

+ Combines the Divvy trip data into a single data frame.

+ Takes additional steps to prepare the data.

Import the 2016 & 2017 Divvy data
=================================

The output is a "list" containing two data frames. Let's extract the
data frames from the list:

```{r inspect-divvy-data}
names(divvy)
stations <- divvy$stations
trips    <- divvy$trips
rm(divvy)
head(stations)
head(trips)
nrow(trips)
```

+ *Were more trips taken in 2016 or 2017?*

+ *Which columns were converted to factors?*

+ *What oddities do you notice from the summary?*

Out first ggplot: a map of the Divvy stations
=============================================

We will use the
[**ggplot2** package](https://github.com/tidyverse/ggplot2). It is a
powerful (though not always intuitive) set of plotting functions that
extend the base plotting fuctions in R.

```{r install-ggplot, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("ggplot2")
```

I also recommend the **cowplot** package, an extension to ggplot2
developed by Claus Wilke at UT Austin.

```{r install-cowplot, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("cowplot")
```

Load the ggplot2 and cowplot functions:

```{r load-ggplot}
library(ggplot2)
library(cowplot)
```

Plot station longitude vs. latitude
===================================

The "stations" data frame gives the geographic co-ordinates (latitude
& longitude) for each station. With ggplot, we can create a station
map from the "stations" data frame in only a few lines of code:

```{r plot-station-map-1}
aes1 <- aes(x = longitude,y = latitude)
p    <- ggplot(stations,aes1)
print(p)
out <- geom_point()
p2  <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p2)
```

*What geographic features of Chicago are recognizable from this plot?*

Adjusting the plot
==================

Let's make a few adjustments to the plot:

```{r plot-station-map-2}
out <- geom_point(shape = 21,fill = "darkblue",
                  color = "white",size = 3)
p3  <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p3)
```

Plotting contours instead of points
===================================

We can reuse our existing code, replacing the `geom_point` with a
`geom_density_2d`, to create a very different plot:

```{r plot-station-map-3}
out  <- geom_density_2d()
p4   <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p4)
```

Use colors to highlight the largest stations
============================================

To do this, map the "dpcapacity" column to colour in the plot:

```{r plot-station-map-4}
aes2 <- aes(x     = longitude,
            y     = latitude,
            color = dpcapacity)
p   <- ggplot(stations,aes2)
out <- geom_point()
p <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p)
```

The colour scale is not great, so let's improve it:

```{r plot-station-map-5}
out <- scale_color_gradient2(low = "white",
  mid = "skyblue",high = "red",midpoint = 25)
p <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p)
```

*Where are the largest Divvy stations?*

Scale stations by the number of departures
==========================================

Next, let's add an additional piece of information to this
visualization:

+ Number of departures at each station, should (?) roughly correspond
to population density.

To do this, we need to add a new column to the "stations" data frame
containing the total number departures, which is calculated from the
"trips" data frame:

```{r count-trips-per-station}
counts <- table(trips$from_station_name)
```

Because we carefully prepared the data frame in `read.divvy.data`,
station counts should be the same order as the stations. We can check
this:

```{r check-station-trip-counts}
all(names(counts) == stations$name)
```

Scale stations by the number of departures
==========================================

Add these trip counts to the "stations" data frame:

```{r add-counts-to-stations}
stations$departures <- as.vector(counts)
head(stations)
```

Let's use this column in our new plot:

```{r plot-station-map-6}
aes3 <- aes(x    = longitude,
            y    = latitude,
    	    size = sqrt(departures))
p    <- ggplot(stations,aes3)
out  <- geom_point(shape = 21,fill = "blue",
                   color = "white")
p    <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p)
```

How to save and share your plot
===============================

For exploratory analyses, GIF and PNG are great formats because the
files are easy to attach to emails or webpages:

```{r save-station-map-png}
ggsave("station_map.png",p,dpi = 100)
```

For print or publication, save in a vector graphics format:

```{r save-station-map-pdf}
ggsave("station_map.pdf",p)
```

Save your code & session state
==============================

This is a good time to save your session.

```{r save-session-2}
save.image("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

Compare 2017 biking activity against 2016
=========================================

Earlier, we observed an increase in trips from 2016 to 2017. Which
stations experienced the largest increase? 

+ To examine this, we need to count trips separately for 2016
  and 2017.

+ Then we add these counts to the "stations" data frame.

We will use the `subset` and `table` to do this:

```{r count-trips-by-year}
d1 <- subset(trips,start.year == 2016)
d2 <- subset(trips,start.year == 2017)
x1 <- table(d1$from_station_name)
x2 <- table(d2$from_station_name)
stations$dep.2016 <- as.vector(x1)
stations$dep.2017 <- as.vector(x2)
head(stations)
```

Scatterplot of trips by station (2016 vs. 2017)
===============================================

As before, now that we have prepared a data frame, plotting with
ggplot is relatively straightforward:

```{r plot-2016-vs-2017-trips-1}
aes3 <- aes(x = dep.2016,y = dep.2017)
p    <- ggplot(stations,aes3)
out  <- geom_point(shape = 20,size = 2)
p    <- ggplot_add(out,p)
print(p)		
```

It is difficult to tell which stations had more trips in 2017—we need
to compare against the x = y line.

```{r plot-2016-vs-2017-trips-2}
out2 <- geom_abline(slope = 1,color = "skyblue",
                    linetype = "dashed")
p    <- ggplot_add(out2,p)
print(p)
```

*One station stands out because it has had a much larger increase in
trips than other stations. What is this station?*

Save your code & session state
==============================

Save your final results for safekeeping.

```{r save-session-3}
save.image("divvyanalysis.RData")
```

ggplot: Take home points
========================

+ Creating sophisticated plots requires relatively little effort
*provided the data are in the right form.*

+ All plots in ggplot2 require these three elements:

    1. A data frame.

    2. An "aesthetic mapping" that declares how columns are mapped to
       plot features (axes, shapes, colors, *etc.*).

    3. A "geom", short for “geometric object,” that specifies the type
        of plot.

+ All plots are created by *adding layers.*


Why data analysis in R?
=======================

+ In R, a spreadsheet ("data frame") is an object that can be inspected,
  manipulated and summarized with code.

+ Therefore, we can write scripts to *automate* our data analyses.

Parting thoughts
================

1. Always record your analysis steps in a file so you can reproduce
   them later.

2. Keep track of which packages (and the versions) you
   used with `sessionInfo()`.

3. Use packages—don’t reinvent the wheel.

4. Email help@rcc.uchicago.edu for advice on using R on the RCC
   cluster.

5. Use "R Markdown" to document your analyses.

6. See the **workflowr** package for simplifying organizing & sharing
   of data analyses; e.g., **stephenslab.github.io/wflow-divvy**.

7. Thank you!
